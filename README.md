### Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is ... well, that depends on where I am. In Mexico, my name is Pedro Galvan Kondo (since we use two last names, our father's and our mother's). But in the USA I am just Pedro Galvan (otherwise they think that Kondo is my last name and Galvan is my middle name). 


* I lead content and technology development at [Software Guru](https://sg.com.mx/about-us). We are a media company & developer relations agency focused on spanish speaking software professionals.
* Where: I am based in Austin, TX but travel frequently to Mexico (mostly Mexico city).
* What I code: As an electronics engineer gone enterprise software developer gone tech writer & developer advocate, I've built software for a great variety of platforms and languages, from Assembler and C to Java EE, PHP, JS and Python. Sadly, nowadays most of the stuff I build are pretty simple web apps (Python+Django) and static sites (Hugo with sprinkles of JS).
* Pronouns: He/him/his.
* Preferences: Juice (real) over beer, mountains over beach, community over code, chocolate over everything.
* Rant: In Mexico, as in most countries with Spanish or French influence/colonization, we consider America a single continent. This, in comparison to England+nordic countries (and their colonies) where they consider North America and South America separate continents. Oh well.
